Introduction\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap to-\nwards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Beyond closed-source models, open-source models,\nincluding DeepSeek series (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a,b,c; Guo et al., 2024), LLaMA series (AI@Meta,\n2024a,b; Touvron et al., 2023a,b), Qwen series (Qwen, 2023, 2024a,b), and Mistral series (Jiang\net al., 2023; Mistral, 2024), are also making significant strides, endeavoring to close the gap with\ntheir closed-source counterparts. To further push the boundaries of open-source model capa-\nbilities, we scale up our models and introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 671B parameters, of which 37B are activated for each token.\nWith a forward-looking perspective, we consistently strive for strong model performance",

These two architectures have been validated in DeepSeek-\nV2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), demonstrating their capability to maintain robust model performance\nwhile achieving efficient training and inference. Beyond the basic architecture, we implement\ntwo additional strategies to further enhance the model capabilities.

Low-precision training\nhas emerged as a promising solution for efficient training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Kalamkar et al.,\n2019; Narang et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2023b), its evolution being closely tied to advancements in\nhardware capabilities (Luo et al., 2024; Micikevicius et al., 2022; Rouhani et al., 2023a).

Through the support for FP8 computation\nand storage, we achieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage. As for\nthe training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism,\nwhich has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through\ncomputation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up,\nas long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ\nfine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead.\nIn addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize",

Discussion About Block-Wise Quantization\nAlthough our tile-wise fine-grained quantization effectively mitigates the error introduced\nby feature outliers, it requires different groupings for activation quantization, i.e., 1x128 in\nforward pass and 128x1 for backward pass. A similar process is also required for the activation\ngradient. A straightforward strategy is to apply block-wise quantization per 128x128 elements\nlike the way we quantize the model weights. In this way, only transposition is required for\nbackward. Therefore, we conduct an experiment where all tensors associated with Dgrad are",

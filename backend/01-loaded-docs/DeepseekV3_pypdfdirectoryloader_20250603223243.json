To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective\ntraining, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architec-\ntures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers\nan auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training\nobjective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and\nhigh-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to\nfully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms\nother open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source\nmodels. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours\nfor its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable.

      "content": "1. Introduction\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap to-\nwards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Beyond closed-source models, open-source models,\nincluding DeepSeek series (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a,b,c; Guo et al., 2024), LLaMA series (AI@Meta,\n2024a,b; Touvron et al., 2023a,b), Qwen series (Qwen, 2023, 2024a,b), and Mistral series (Jiang\net al., 2023; Mistral, 2024), are also making significant strides, endeavoring to close the gap with\ntheir closed-source counterparts. To further push the boundaries of open-source model capa-\nbilities, we scale up our models and introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 671B parameters, of which 37B are activated for each token.\nWith a forward-looking perspective, we consistently strive for strong model performance\nand economical costs. Therefore, in terms of architecture, DeepSeek-V3 still adopts Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) for efficient inference and DeepSeekMoE (Dai\net al., 2024) for cost-effective training. These two architectures have been validated in DeepSeek-\nV2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), demonstrating their capability to maintain robust model performance\nwhile achieving efficient training and inference. Beyond the basic architecture, we implement\ntwo additional strategies to further enhance the model capabilities. Firstly, DeepSeek-V3 pi-\noneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) for load balancing, with the aim of\nminimizing the adverse impact on model performance that arises from the effort to encourage\nload balancing. Secondly, DeepSeek-V3 employs a multi-token prediction training objective,\nwhich we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks.\nIn order to achieve efficient training, we support the FP8 mixed precision training and\nimplement comprehensive optimizations for the training framework. Low-precision training\nhas emerged as a promising solution for efficient training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Kalamkar et al.,\n2019; Narang et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2023b), its evolution being closely tied to advancements in\nhardware capabilities (Luo et al., 2024; Micikevicius et al., 2022; Rouhani et al., 2023a). In this\nwork, we introduce an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate\nits effectiveness on an extremely large-scale model. Through the support for FP8 computation\nand storage, we achieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage. As for\nthe training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism,\nwhich has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through\ncomputation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up,\nas long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ\nfine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead.\nIn addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize\nInfiniBand (IB) and NVLink bandwidths. Furthermore, we meticulously optimize the memory\nfootprint, making it possible to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly tensor parallelism.\nCombining these efforts, we achieve high training efficiency.\nDuring pre-training, we train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens. The\npre-training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not\nencounter any irrecoverable loss spikes or have to roll back. Next, we conduct a two-stage\ncontext length extension for DeepSeek-V3. In the first stage, the maximum context length is\nextended to 32K, and in the second stage, it is further extended to 128K. Following this, we\nconduct post-training, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)\non the base model of DeepSeek-V3, to align it with human preferences and further unlock its\npotential. During the post-training stage, we distill the reasoning capability from the DeepSeek-\nR1 series of models, and meanwhile carefully maintain the balance between model accuracy\n4",

Despite its economical\ntraining costs, comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3-Base has emerged as the\nstrongest open-source base model currently available, especially in code and math. Its chat\nversion also outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to\nleading closed-source models, including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, on a series of standard\nand open-ended benchmarks.\nLastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in\nTable 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware.\nDuring the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K\nH800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pre-\ntraining stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined\nwith 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training,\nDeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of\nthe H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. Note that\nthe aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs\nassociated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.\nOur main contribution includes:\nArchitecture: Innovative Load Balancing Strategy and Training Objective\n•On top of the efficient architecture of DeepSeek-V2, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free\nstrategy for load balancing, which minimizes the performance degradation that arises\nfrom encouraging load balancing.\n•We investigate a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective and prove it beneficial to model\nperformance. It can also be used for speculative decoding for inference acceleration.\nPre-Training: Towards Ultimate Training Efficiency\n•We design an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model.\n•Through the co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, we overcome the\ncommunication bottleneck in cross-node MoE training, achieving near-full computation-\ncommunication overlap. This significantly enhances our training efficiency and reduces the\ntraining costs, enabling us to further scale up the model size without additional overhead.\n•At an economical cost of only 2.664M H800 GPU hours, we complete the pre-training of\nDeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens, producing the currently strongest open-source base model.\nThe subsequent training stages after pre-training require only 0.1M GPU hours.\nPost-Training: Knowledge Distillation from DeepSeek-R1\n•We introduce an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from the long-\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models,\ninto standard LLMs, particularly DeepSeek-V3.

(2) On coding-related tasks,\nDeepSeek-V3 emerges as the top-performing model for coding competition benchmarks,\nsuch as LiveCodeBench, solidifying its position as the leading model in this domain. For\nengineering-related tasks, while DeepSeek-V3 performs slightly below Claude-Sonnet-3.5,\nit still outpaces all other models by a significant margin, demonstrating its competitiveness\nacross diverse technical benchmarks.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we first present a detailed exposition of our DeepSeek-V3\nmodel architecture (Section 2). Subsequently, we introduce our infrastructures, encompassing\nour compute clusters, the training framework, the support for FP8 training, the inference\ndeployment strategy, and our suggestions on future hardware design. Next, we describe our\npre-training process, including the construction of training data, hyper-parameter settings, long-\ncontext extension techniques, the associated evaluations, as well as some discussions (Section 4).\nThereafter, we discuss our efforts on post-training, which include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),\nReinforcement Learning (RL), the corresponding evaluations, and discussions (Section 5). Lastly,\nwe conclude this work, discuss existing limitations of DeepSeek-V3, and propose potential\ndirections for future research (Section 6).\n2. Architecture\nWe first introduce the basic architecture of DeepSeek-V3, featured by Multi-head Latent Atten-\ntion (MLA) (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) for efficient inference and DeepSeekMoE (Dai et al., 2024)\nfor economical training. Then, we present a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) training objective,\nwhich we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks. For\nother minor details not explicitly mentioned, DeepSeek-V3 adheres to the settings of DeepSeek-\nV2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c).\n2.1. Basic Architecture\nThe basic architecture of DeepSeek-V3 is still within the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017)\nframework. For efficient inference and economical training, DeepSeek-V3 also adopts MLA\nand DeepSeekMoE, which have been thoroughly validated by DeepSeek-V2.

Slightly different from DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3 uses the sigmoid function\nto compute the affinity scores, and applies a normalization among all selected affinity scores to\nproduce the gating values.\nAuxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing. For MoE models, an unbalanced expert load will lead to\nrouting collapse (Shazeer et al., 2017) and diminish computational efficiency in scenarios with\nexpert parallelism. Conventional solutions usually rely on the auxiliary loss (Fedus et al., 2021;\nLepikhin et al., 2021) to avoid unbalanced load. However, too large an auxiliary loss will impair\nthe model performance (Wang et al., 2024a). To achieve a better trade-off between load balance\nand model performance, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy (Wang et al.,\n2024a) to ensure load balance. To be specific, we introduce a bias term 𝑏𝑖for each expert and\nadd it to the corresponding affinity scores 𝑠𝑖,𝑡to determine the top-K routing:\n𝑔′\n𝑖,𝑡=(\n𝑠𝑖,𝑡,𝑠𝑖,𝑡+𝑏𝑖∈Topk({𝑠𝑗,𝑡+𝑏𝑗|1⩽𝑗⩽𝑁𝑟},𝐾𝑟),\n0, otherwise.(16)\nNote that the bias term is only used for routing. The gating value, which will be multiplied with\nthe FFN output, is still derived from the original affinity score 𝑠𝑖,𝑡. During training, we keep\nmonitoring the expert load on the whole batch of each training step. At the end of each step,\nwe will decrease the bias term by 𝛾if its corresponding expert is overloaded, and increase it by\n𝛾if its corresponding expert is underloaded, where 𝛾is a hyper-parameter called bias update\nspeed. Through the dynamic adjustment, DeepSeek-V3 keeps balanced expert load during\ntraining, and achieves better performance than models that encourage load balance through\npure auxiliary losses.\nComplementary Sequence-Wise Auxiliary Loss. Although DeepSeek-V3 mainly relies on the\nauxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balance, to prevent extreme imbalance within any single\nsequence, we also employ a complementary sequence-wise balance loss:\nLBal=𝛼𝑁𝑟∑︁\n𝑖=1𝑓𝑖𝑃𝑖, (17)\n𝑓𝑖=𝑁𝑟\n𝐾𝑟𝑇𝑇∑︁\n𝑡=11\u0000\n𝑠𝑖,𝑡∈Topk({𝑠𝑗,𝑡|1⩽𝑗⩽𝑁𝑟},𝐾𝑟)\u0001, (18)\n𝑠′\n𝑖,𝑡=𝑠𝑖,𝑡Í𝑁𝑟\n𝑗=1𝑠𝑗,𝑡, (19)\n𝑃𝑖=1\n𝑇𝑇∑︁\n𝑡=1𝑠′\n𝑖,𝑡, (20)\nwhere the balance factor 𝛼is a hyper-parameter, which will be assigned an extremely small\nvalue for DeepSeek-V3; 1(·)denotes the indicator function; and 𝑇denotes the number of tokens\nin a sequence.

We keep the\ncomplete causal chain for the prediction of each token at each depth.\nNode-Limited Routing. Like the device-limited routing used by DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3\nalso uses a restricted routing mechanism to limit communication costs during training. In short,\nwe ensure that each token will be sent to at most 𝑀nodes, which are selected according to\nthe sum of the highest𝐾𝑟\n𝑀affinity scores of the experts distributed on each node. Under this\nconstraint, our MoE training framework can nearly achieve full computation-communication\noverlap.\nNo Token-Dropping.

In addition, we also implement specific deployment strategies to ensure inference load\nbalance, so DeepSeek-V3 also does not drop tokens during inference.\n2.2. Multi-Token Prediction\nInspired by Gloeckle et al. (2024), we investigate and set a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)\nobjective for DeepSeek-V3, which extends the prediction scope to multiple future tokens at each\nposition. On the one hand, an MTP objective densifies the training signals and may improve\ndata efficiency. On the other hand, MTP may enable the model to pre-plan its representations\nfor better prediction of future tokens. Figure 3 illustrates our implementation of MTP . Different\nfrom Gloeckle et al. (2024), which parallelly predicts 𝐷additional tokens using independent\noutput heads, we sequentially predict additional tokens and keep the complete causal chain at\neach prediction depth. We introduce the details of our MTP implementation in this section.\nMTP Modules. To be specific, our MTP implementation uses 𝐷sequential modules to predict 𝐷\nadditional tokens. The 𝑘-th MTP module consists of a shared embedding layer Emb(·), a shared\noutput head OutHead(·), a Transformer block TRM𝑘(·), and a projection matrix 𝑀𝑘∈R𝑑×2𝑑. For\nthe𝑖-th input token 𝑡𝑖, at the𝑘-th prediction depth, we first combine the representation of the 𝑖-th\ntoken at the(𝑘−1)-th depth h𝑘−1\n𝑖∈R𝑑and the embedding of the (𝑖+𝑘)-th token𝐸𝑚𝑏(𝑡𝑖+𝑘)∈R𝑑\n10",

The combined h′𝑘\n𝑖serves as the input of the Transformer block at the 𝑘-th depth to\nproduce the output representation at the current depth h𝑘\n𝑖:\nh𝑘\n1:𝑇−𝑘=TRM𝑘(h′𝑘\n1:𝑇−𝑘), (22)\nwhere𝑇represents the input sequence length and 𝑖:𝑗denotes the slicing operation (inclusive of\nboth the left and right boundaries).

Our principle of\nmaintaining the causal chain of predictions is similar to that of EAGLE (Li et al., 2024b), but its\nprimary objective is speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023), whereas we\nutilize MTP to improve training.\nMTP Training Objective.

Additionally, we can also repurpose these MTP modules\nfor speculative decoding to further improve the generation latency.\n3. Infrastructures\n3.1. Compute Clusters\nDeepSeek-V3 is trained on a cluster equipped with 2048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs. Each node in\nthe H800 cluster contains 8 GPUs connected by NVLink and NVSwitch within nodes. Across\ndifferent nodes, InfiniBand (IB) interconnects are utilized to facilitate communications.\n11",

Orange denotes forward, green denotes\n\"backward for input\", blue denotes \"backward for weights\", purple denotes PP communication,\nand red denotes barriers. Both all-to-all and PP communication can be fully hidden.\n3.2. Training Framework\nThe training of DeepSeek-V3 is supported by the HAI-LLM framework, an efficient and\nlightweight training framework crafted by our engineers from the ground up. On the whole,\nDeepSeek-V3 applies 16-way Pipeline Parallelism (PP) (Qi et al., 2023a), 64-way Expert Paral-\nlelism (EP) (Lepikhin et al., 2021) spanning 8 nodes, and ZeRO-1 Data Parallelism (DP) (Rajb-\nhandari et al., 2020).\nIn order to facilitate efficient training of DeepSeek-V3, we implement meticulous engineering\noptimizations. Firstly, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism.\nCompared with existing PP methods, DualPipe has fewer pipeline bubbles. More importantly, it\noverlaps the computation and communication phases across forward and backward processes,\nthereby addressing the challenge of heavy communication overhead introduced by cross-node\nexpert parallelism. Secondly, we develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels\nto fully utilize IB and NVLink bandwidths and conserve Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)\ndedicated to communication. Finally, we meticulously optimize the memory footprint during\ntraining, thereby enabling us to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly Tensor Parallelism (TP).\n3.2.1. DualPipe and Computation-Communication Overlap\nFor DeepSeek-V3, the communication overhead introduced by cross-node expert parallelism\nresults in an inefficient computation-to-communication ratio of approximately 1:1. To tackle this\nchallenge, we design an innovative pipeline parallelism algorithm called DualPipe, which not\nonly accelerates model training by effectively overlapping forward and backward computation-\ncommunication phases, but also reduces the pipeline bubbles.\nThe key idea of DualPipe is to overlap the computation and communication within a pair of\nindividual forward and backward chunks. To be specific, we divide each chunk into four compo-\nnents: attention ,all-to-all dispatch ,MLP, and all-to-all combine . Specially, for\na backward chunk, both attention andMLP are further split into two parts, backward for\ninput andbackward for weights , like in ZeroBubble (Qi et al., 2023b). In addition, we\nhave a PP communication component. As illustrated in Figure 4, for a pair of forward and\nbackward chunks, we rearrange these components and manually adjust the ratio of GPU SMs\ndedicated to communication versus computation. In this overlapping strategy, we can ensure\nthat both all-to-all and PP communication can be fully hidden during execution. Given the\nefficient overlapping strategy, the full DualPipe scheduling is illustrated in Figure 5. It employs\na bidirectional pipeline scheduling, which feeds micro-batches from both ends of the pipeline\nsimultaneously and a significant portion of communications can be fully overlapped. This\noverlap also ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant\ncomputation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes\nwhile achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead.\n12",

In Table 2, we summarize the pipeline bubbles and\nmemory usage across different PP methods. As shown in the table, compared with ZB1P (Qi\net al., 2023b) and 1F1B (Harlap et al., 2018), DualPipe significantly reduces the pipeline bubbles\nwhile only increasing the peak activation memory by1\n𝑃𝑃times. Although DualPipe requires\nkeeping two copies of the model parameters, this does not significantly increase the memory\nconsumption since we use a large EP size during training. Compared with Chimera (Li and\nHoefler, 2021), DualPipe only requires that the pipeline stages and micro-batches be divisible by\n2, without requiring micro-batches to be divisible by pipeline stages. In addition, for DualPipe,\nneither the bubbles nor activation memory will increase as the number of micro-batches grows.\n3.2.2. Efficient Implementation of Cross-Node All-to-All Communication\nIn order to ensure sufficient computational performance for DualPipe, we customize efficient\ncross-node all-to-all communication kernels (including dispatching and combining) to conserve\nthe number of SMs dedicated to communication. The implementation of the kernels is co-\ndesigned with the MoE gating algorithm and the network topology of our cluster. To be specific,\nin our cluster, cross-node GPUs are fully interconnected with IB, and intra-node communications\nare handled via NVLink. NVLink offers a bandwidth of 160 GB/s, roughly 3.2 times that of IB\n(50 GB/s). To effectively leverage the different bandwidths of IB and NVLink, we limit each\ntoken to be dispatched to at most 4 nodes, thereby reducing IB traffic. For each token, when its\nrouting decision is made, it will first be transmitted via IB to the GPUs with the same in-node\nindex on its target nodes. Once it reaches the target nodes, we will endeavor to ensure that it is\ninstantaneously forwarded via NVLink to specific GPUs that host their target experts, without\nbeing blocked by subsequently arriving tokens. In this way, communications via IB and NVLink\nare fully overlapped, and each token can efficiently select an average of 3.2 experts per node\nwithout incurring additional overhead from NVLink. This implies that, although DeepSeek-V3\n13",

Overall, under\nsuch a communication strategy, only 20 SMs are sufficient to fully utilize the bandwidths of IB\nand NVLink.\nIn detail, we employ the warp specialization technique (Bauer et al., 2014) and partition\n20 SMs into 10 communication channels. During the dispatching process, (1) IB sending, (2)\nIB-to-NVLink forwarding, and (3) NVLink receiving are handled by respective warps. The\nnumber of warps allocated to each communication task is dynamically adjusted according to the\nactual workload across all SMs. Similarly, during the combining process, (1) NVLink sending,\n(2) NVLink-to-IB forwarding and accumulation, and (3) IB receiving and accumulation are also\nhandled by dynamically adjusted warps. In addition, both dispatching and combining kernels\noverlap with the computation stream, so we also consider their impact on other SM computation\nkernels. Specifically, we employ customized PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) instructions and\nauto-tune the communication chunk size, which significantly reduces the use of the L2 cache\nand the interference to other SMs.\n3.2.3. Extremely Memory Saving with Minimal Overhead\nIn order to reduce the memory footprint during training, we employ the following techniques.\nRecomputation of RMSNorm and MLA Up-Projection. We recompute all RMSNorm op-\nerations and MLA up-projections during back-propagation, thereby eliminating the need to\npersistently store their output activations. With a minor overhead, this strategy significantly\nreduces memory requirements for storing activations.\nExponential Moving Average in CPU. During training, we preserve the Exponential Mov-\ning Average (EMA) of the model parameters for early estimation of the model performance\nafter learning rate decay. The EMA parameters are stored in CPU memory and are updated\nasynchronously after each training step. This method allows us to maintain EMA parameters\nwithout incurring additional memory or time overhead.\nShared Embedding and Output Head for Multi-Token Prediction. With the DualPipe strategy,\nwe deploy the shallowest layers (including the embedding layer) and deepest layers (including\nthe output head) of the model on the same PP rank. This arrangement enables the physical\nsharing of parameters and gradients, of the shared embedding and output head, between the\nMTP module and the main model. This physical sharing mechanism further enhances our\nmemory efficiency.\n3.3. FP8 Training\nInspired by recent advances in low-precision training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Noune et al., 2022;\nPeng et al., 2023b), we propose a fine-grained mixed precision framework utilizing the FP8\ndata format for training DeepSeek-V3. While low-precision training holds great promise, it\nis often limited by the presence of outliers in activations, weights, and gradients (Fishman\net al., 2024; He et al.; Sun et al., 2024). Although significant progress has been made in in-\nference quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023), there are relatively few studies\ndemonstrating successful application of low-precision techniques in large-scale language model\n14",

The associated dequantiza-\ntion overhead is largely mitigated under our increased-precision accumulation process, a critical\naspect for achieving accurate FP8 General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). Moreover, to further\nreduce memory and communication overhead in MoE training, we cache and dispatch activa-\ntions in FP8, while storing low-precision optimizer states in BF16. We validate the proposed FP8\nmixed precision framework on two model scales similar to DeepSeek-V2-Lite and DeepSeek-\nV2, training for approximately 1 trillion tokens (see more details in Appendix B.1). Notably,\ncompared with the BF16 baseline, the relative loss error of our FP8-training model remains\nconsistently below 0.25%, a level well within the acceptable range of training randomness.\n3.3.1. Mixed Precision Framework\nBuilding upon widely adopted techniques in low-precision training (Kalamkar et al., 2019;\nNarang et al., 2017), we propose a mixed precision framework for FP8 training. In this frame-\nwork, most compute-density operations are conducted in FP8, while a few key operations\nare strategically maintained in their original data formats to balance training efficiency and\nnumerical stability. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 6.\nFirstly, in order to accelerate model training, the majority of core computation kernels, i.e.,\nGEMM operations, are implemented in FP8 precision. These GEMM operations accept FP8\ntensors as inputs and produce outputs in BF16 or FP32. As depicted in Figure 6, all three GEMMs\nassociated with the Linear operator, namely Fprop (forward pass), Dgrad (activation backward\npass), and Wgrad (weight backward pass), are executed in FP8. This design theoretically doubles\nthe computational speed compared with the original BF16 method. Additionally, the FP8 Wgrad\nGEMM allows activations to be stored in FP8 for use in the backward pass. This significantly\nreduces memory consumption.\nDespite the efficiency advantage of the FP8 format, certain operators still require a higher\nprecision due to their sensitivity to low-precision computations. Besides, some low-cost opera-\ntors can also utilize a higher precision with a negligible overhead to the overall training cost. For\nthis reason, after careful investigations, we maintain the original precision (e.g., BF16 or FP32)\nfor the following components: the embedding module, the output head, MoE gating modules,\nnormalization operators, and attention operators. These targeted retentions of high precision\nensure stable training dynamics for DeepSeek-V3. To further guarantee numerical stability, we\nstore the master weights, weight gradients, and optimizer states in higher precision. While\n15",

Improved Precision from Quantization and Multiplication\nBased on our mixed precision FP8 framework, we introduce several strategies to enhance low-\nprecision training accuracy, focusing on both the quantization method and the multiplication\nprocess.\nFine-Grained Quantization. In low-precision training frameworks, overflows and underflows\nare common challenges due to the limited dynamic range of the FP8 format, which is constrained\nby its reduced exponent bits. As a standard practice, the input distribution is aligned to the\nrepresentable range of the FP8 format by scaling the maximum absolute value of the input\ntensor to the maximum representable value of FP8 (Narang et al., 2017). This method makes low-\nprecision training highly sensitive to activation outliers, which can heavily degrade quantization\naccuracy. To solve this, we propose a fine-grained quantization method that applies scaling\nat a more granular level. As illustrated in Figure 7 (a), (1) for activations, we group and\nscale elements on a 1x128 tile basis (i.e., per token per 128 channels); and (2) for weights, we\ngroup and scale elements on a 128x128 block basis (i.e., per 128 input channels per 128 output\nchannels). This approach ensures that the quantization process can better accommodate outliers\nby adapting the scale according to smaller groups of elements. In Appendix B.2, we further\ndiscuss the training instability when we group and scale activations on a block basis in the same\nway as weights quantization.\nOne key modification in our method is the introduction of per-group scaling factors along\nthe inner dimension of GEMM operations. This functionality is not directly supported in the\nstandard FP8 GEMM. However, combined with our precise FP32 accumulation strategy, it can\n16",

We hope our design can serve as a reference for\nfuture work to keep pace with the latest GPU architectures.\nIncreasing Accumulation Precision. Low-precision GEMM operations often suffer from un-\nderflow issues, and their accuracy largely depends on high-precision accumulation, which is\ncommonly performed in an FP32 precision (Kalamkar et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2017). However,\nwe observe that the accumulation precision of FP8 GEMM on NVIDIA H800 GPUs is limited to\nretaining around 14 bits, which is significantly lower than FP32 accumulation precision. This\nproblem will become more pronounced when the inner dimension Kis large (Wortsman et al.,\n2023), a typical scenario in large-scale model training where the batch size and model width\nare increased. Taking GEMM operations of two random matrices with K= 4096 for example, in\nour preliminary test, the limited accumulation precision in Tensor Cores results in a maximum\nrelative error of nearly 2%. Despite these problems, the limited accumulation precision is still\nthe default option in a few FP8 frameworks (NVIDIA, 2024b), severely constraining the training\naccuracy.\nIn order to address this issue, we adopt the strategy of promotion to CUDA Cores for\nhigher precision (Thakkar et al., 2023). The process is illustrated in Figure 7 (b). To be specific,\nduring MMA (Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) execution on Tensor Cores, intermediate results\nare accumulated using the limited bit width. Once an interval of 𝑁𝐶is reached, these partial\nresults will be copied to FP32 registers on CUDA Cores, where full-precision FP32 accumulation\nis performed. As mentioned before, our fine-grained quantization applies per-group scaling\nfactors along the inner dimension K. These scaling factors can be efficiently multiplied on the\nCUDA Cores as the dequantization process with minimal additional computational cost.\nIt is worth noting that this modification reduces the WGMMA (Warpgroup-level Matrix\nMultiply-Accumulate) instruction issue rate for a single warpgroup. However, on the H800\narchitecture, it is typical for two WGMMA to persist concurrently: while one warpgroup\nperforms the promotion operation, the other is able to execute the MMA operation. This design\nenables overlapping of the two operations, maintaining high utilization of Tensor Cores. Based\non our experiments, setting 𝑁𝐶=128elements, equivalent to 4 WGMMAs, represents the\nminimal accumulation interval that can significantly improve precision without introducing\nsubstantial overhead.\nMantissa over Exponents. In contrast to the hybrid FP8 format adopted by prior work\n(NVIDIA, 2024b; Peng et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2019b), which uses E4M3 (4-bit exponent and\n3-bit mantissa) in Fprop andE5M2 (5-bit exponent and 2-bit mantissa) in Dgrad andWgrad ,\nwe adopt the E4M3 format on all tensors for higher precision. We attribute the feasibility of\nthis approach to our fine-grained quantization strategy, i.e., tile and block-wise scaling. By\noperating on smaller element groups, our methodology effectively shares exponent bits among\nthese grouped elements, mitigating the impact of the limited dynamic range.\nOnline Quantization. Delayed quantization is employed in tensor-wise quantization frame-\nworks (NVIDIA, 2024b; Peng et al., 2023b), which maintains a history of the maximum absolute\n17",

In order to ensure accurate scales and\nsimplify the framework, we calculate the maximum absolute value online for each 1x128 acti-\nvation tile or 128x128 weight block. Based on it, we derive the scaling factor and then quantize\nthe activation or weight online into the FP8 format.\n3.3.3. Low-Precision Storage and Communication\nIn conjunction with our FP8 training framework, we further reduce the memory consumption\nand communication overhead by compressing cached activations and optimizer states into\nlower-precision formats.\nLow-Precision Optimizer States. We adopt the BF16 data format instead of FP32 to track the\nfirst and second moments in the AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) optimizer, without\nincurring observable performance degradation. However, the master weights (stored by the\noptimizer) and gradients (used for batch size accumulation) are still retained in FP32 to ensure\nnumerical stability throughout training.\nLow-Precision Activation. As illustrated in Figure 6, the Wgrad operation is performed in FP8.\nTo reduce the memory consumption, it is a natural choice to cache activations in FP8 format\nfor the backward pass of the Linear operator. However, special considerations are taken on\nseveral operators for low-cost high-precision training:\n(1) Inputs of the Linear after the attention operator. These activations are also\nused in the backward pass of the attention operator, which makes it sensitive to\nprecision. We adopt a customized E5M6 data format exclusively for these activations.\nAdditionally, these activations will be converted from an 1x128 quantization tile to\nan128x1 tile in the backward pass. To avoid introducing extra quantization error,\nall the scaling factors are round scaled, i.e., integral power of 2.\n(2) Inputs of the SwiGLU operator in MoE. To further reduce the memory cost, we\ncache the inputs of the SwiGLU operator and recompute its output in the backward\npass. These activations are also stored in FP8 with our fine-grained quantization\nmethod, striking a balance between memory efficiency and computational accuracy.\nLow-Precision Communication. Communication bandwidth is a critical bottleneck in the\ntraining of MoE models. To alleviate this challenge, we quantize the activation before MoE\nup-projections into FP8 and then apply dispatch components, which is compatible with\nFP8Fprop in MoE up-projections. Like the inputs of the Linear after the attention operator,\nscaling factors for this activation are integral power of 2. A similar strategy is applied to the\nactivation gradient before MoE down-projections. For both the forward and backward combine\ncomponents, we retain them in BF16 to preserve training precision in critical parts of the training\npipeline.\n3.4. Inference and Deployment\nWe deploy DeepSeek-V3 on the H800 cluster, where GPUs within each node are interconnected\nusing NVLink, and all GPUs across the cluster are fully interconnected via IB. To simultaneously\nensure both the Service-Level Objective (SLO) for online services and high throughput, we\nemploy the following deployment strategy that separates the prefilling and decoding stages.\n18",

The\nattention part employs 4-way Tensor Parallelism (TP4) with Sequence Parallelism (SP), com-\nbined with 8-way Data Parallelism (DP8). Its small TP size of 4 limits the overhead of TP\ncommunication. For the MoE part, we use 32-way Expert Parallelism (EP32), which ensures that\neach expert processes a sufficiently large batch size, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.\nFor the MoE all-to-all communication, we use the same method as in training: first transferring\ntokens across nodes via IB, and then forwarding among the intra-node GPUs via NVLink. In\nparticular, we use 1-way Tensor Parallelism for the dense MLPs in shallow layers to save TP\ncommunication.\nTo achieve load balancing among different experts in the MoE part, we need to ensure that\neach GPU processes approximately the same number of tokens. To this end, we introduce a\ndeployment strategy of redundant experts , which duplicates high-load experts and deploys them\nredundantly. The high-load experts are detected based on statistics collected during the online\ndeployment and are adjusted periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes). After determining the set\nof redundant experts, we carefully rearrange experts among GPUs within a node based on the\nobserved loads, striving to balance the load across GPUs as much as possible without increasing\nthe cross-node all-to-all communication overhead. For the deployment of DeepSeek-V3, we set\n32 redundant experts for the prefilling stage. For each GPU, besides the original 8 experts it\nhosts, it will also host one additional redundant expert.\nFurthermore, in the prefilling stage, to improve the throughput and hide the overhead of\nall-to-all and TP communication, we simultaneously process two micro-batches with similar\ncomputational workloads, overlapping the attention andMoE of one micro-batch with the\ndispatch andcombine of another.\nFinally, we are exploring a dynamic redundancy strategy for experts, where each GPU hosts\nmore experts (e.g., 16 experts), but only 9 will be activated during each inference step. Before\nthe all-to-all operation at each layer begins, we compute the globally optimal routing scheme\non the fly. Given the substantial computation involved in the prefilling stage, the overhead of\ncomputing this routing scheme is almost negligible.\n3.4.2. Decoding\nDuring decoding, we treat the shared expert as a routed one. From this perspective, each token\nwill select 9 experts during routing, where the shared expert is regarded as a heavy-load one\nthat will always be selected. The minimum deployment unit of the decoding stage consists\nof 40 nodes with 320 GPUs. The attention part employs TP4 with SP , combined with DP80,\nwhile the MoE part uses EP320. For the MoE part, each GPU hosts only one expert, and 64 GPUs\nare responsible for hosting redundant experts and shared experts. All-to-all communication\nof the dispatch andcombine parts is performed via direct point-to-point transfers over IB to\nachieve low latency. Additionally, we leverage the IBGDA (NVIDIA, 2022) technology to further\nminimize latency and enhance communication efficiency.\nSimilar to prefilling, we periodically determine the set of redundant experts in a certain\ninterval, based on the statistical expert load from our online service. However, we do not need\nto rearrange experts since each GPU only hosts one expert. We are also exploring the dynamic\nredundancy strategy for decoding. However, this requires more careful optimization of the\nalgorithm that computes the globally optimal routing scheme and the fusion with the dispatch\nkernel to reduce overhead.\n19",

In the decoding stage, the batch size per expert\nis relatively small (usually within 256 tokens), and the bottleneck is memory access rather\nthan computation. Since the MoE part only needs to load the parameters of one expert, the\nmemory access overhead is minimal, so using fewer SMs will not significantly affect the overall\nperformance. Therefore, to avoid impacting the computation speed of the attention part, we\ncan allocate only a small portion of SMs to dispatch+MoE+combine .\n3.5. Suggestions on Hardware Design\nBased on our implementation of the all-to-all communication and FP8 training scheme, we\npropose the following suggestions on chip design to AI hardware vendors.\n3.5.1. Communication Hardware\nIn DeepSeek-V3, we implement the overlap between computation and communication to hide\nthe communication latency during computation. This significantly reduces the dependency\non communication bandwidth compared to serial computation and communication. However,\nthe current communication implementation relies on expensive SMs (e.g., we allocate 20 out of\nthe 132 SMs available in the H800 GPU for this purpose), which will limit the computational\nthroughput. Moreover, using SMs for communication results in significant inefficiencies, as\ntensor cores remain entirely under-utilized.\nCurrently, the SMs primarily perform the following tasks for all-to-all communication:\n•Forwarding data between the IB (InfiniBand) and NVLink domain while aggregating IB\ntraffic destined for multiple GPUs within the same node from a single GPU.\n•Transporting data between RDMA buffers (registered GPU memory regions) and in-\nput/output buffers.\n•Executing reduce operations forall-to-all combine .\n•Managing fine-grained memory layout during chunked data transferring to multiple\nexperts across the IB and NVLink domain.\nWe aspire to see future vendors developing hardware that offloads these communication\ntasks from the valuable computation unit SM, serving as a GPU co-processor or a network\nco-processor like NVIDIA SHARP Graham et al. (2016). Furthermore, to reduce application\nprogramming complexity, we aim for this hardware to unify the IB (scale-out) and NVLink\n(scale-up) networks from the perspective of the computation units. With this unified interface,\ncomputation units can easily accomplish operations such as read ,write ,multicast , and\nreduce across the entire IB-NVLink-unified domain via submitting communication requests\nbased on simple primitives.\n3.5.2. Compute Hardware\nHigher FP8 GEMM Accumulation Precision in Tensor Cores. In the current Tensor Core\nimplementation of the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, FP8 GEMM suffers from limited accumula-\ntion precision. After aligning 32 mantissa products by right-shifting based on the maximum\nexponent, the Tensor Core only uses the highest 14 bits of each mantissa product for addition,\n20",

Our implementation partially mitigates the limitation by accumulating\nthe addition results of 128 FP8 ×FP8 multiplications into registers with FP32 precision in the\nCUDA core. Although helpful in achieving successful FP8 training, it is merely a compromise\ndue to the Hopper architecture’s hardware deficiency in FP8 GEMM accumulation precision.\nFuture chips need to adopt higher precision.\nSupport for Tile- and Block-Wise Quantization. Current GPUs only support per-tensor\nquantization, lacking the native support for fine-grained quantization like our tile- and block-\nwise quantization. In the current implementation, when the 𝑁𝐶interval is reached, the partial\nresults will be copied from Tensor Cores to CUDA cores, multiplied by the scaling factors, and\nadded to FP32 registers on CUDA cores. Although the dequantization overhead is significantly\nmitigated combined with our precise FP32 accumulation strategy, the frequent data movements\nbetween Tensor Cores and CUDA cores still limit the computational efficiency. Therefore, we\nrecommend future chips to support fine-grained quantization by enabling Tensor Cores to\nreceive scaling factors and implement MMA with group scaling. In this way, the whole partial\nsum accumulation and dequantization can be completed directly inside Tensor Cores until the\nfinal result is produced, avoiding frequent data movements.\nSupport for Online Quantization. The current implementations struggle to effectively support\nonline quantization, despite its effectiveness demonstrated in our research. In the existing\nprocess, we need to read 128 BF16 activation values (the output of the previous computation)\nfrom HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for quantization, and the quantized FP8 values are\nthen written back to HBM, only to be read again for MMA. To address this inefficiency, we\nrecommend that future chips integrate FP8 cast and TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) access\ninto a single fused operation, so quantization can be completed during the transfer of activations\nfrom global memory to shared memory, avoiding frequent memory reads and writes. We also\nrecommend supporting a warp-level cast instruction for speedup, which further facilitates the\nbetter fusion of layer normalization and FP8 cast. Alternatively, a near-memory computing\napproach can be adopted, where compute logic is placed near the HBM. In this case, BF16\nelements can be cast to FP8 directly as they are read from HBM into the GPU, reducing off-chip\nmemory access by roughly 50%.\nSupport for Transposed GEMM Operations. The current architecture makes it cumbersome\nto fuse matrix transposition with GEMM operations. In our workflow, activations during the\nforward pass are quantized into 1x128 FP8 tiles and stored. During the backward pass, the\nmatrix needs to be read out, dequantized, transposed, re-quantized into 128x1 tiles, and stored\nin HBM. To reduce memory operations, we recommend future chips to enable direct transposed\nreads of matrices from shared memory before MMA operation, for those precisions required\nin both training and inference. Combined with the fusion of FP8 format conversion and TMA\naccess, this enhancement will significantly streamline the quantization workflow.\n4. Pre-Training\n4.1.

Finally, the training corpus for DeepSeek-V3 consists of 14.8T high-quality and diverse\ntokens in our tokenizer.\nIn the training process of DeepSeekCoder-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a), we observe that the\nFill-in-Middle (FIM) strategy does not compromise the next-token prediction capability while\nenabling the model to accurately predict middle text based on contextual cues. In alignment with\nDeepSeekCoder-V2, we also incorporate the FIM strategy in the pre-training of DeepSeek-V3. To\nbe specific, we employ the Prefix-Suffix-Middle (PSM) framework to structure data as follows:\n<|fim_begin|> 𝑓pre<|fim_hole|> 𝑓suf<|fim_end|> 𝑓middle <|eos_token|> .\nThis structure is applied at the document level as a part of the pre-packing process. The FIM\nstrategy is applied at a rate of 0.1, consistent with the PSM framework.\nThe tokenizer for DeepSeek-V3 employs Byte-level BPE (Shibata et al., 1999) with an extended\nvocabulary of 128K tokens. The pretokenizer and training data for our tokenizer are modified\nto optimize multilingual compression efficiency. In addition, compared with DeepSeek-V2,\nthe new pretokenizer introduces tokens that combine punctuations and line breaks. However,\nthis trick may introduce the token boundary bias (Lundberg, 2023) when the model processes\nmulti-line prompts without terminal line breaks, particularly for few-shot evaluation prompts.\nTo address this issue, we randomly split a certain proportion of such combined tokens during\ntraining, which exposes the model to a wider array of special cases and mitigates this bias.\n4.2.

The multi-token prediction depth 𝐷is set to 1, i.e.,\nbesides the exact next token, each token will predict one additional token. As DeepSeek-V2,\nDeepSeek-V3 also employs additional RMSNorm layers after the compressed latent vectors,\nand multiplies additional scaling factors at the width bottlenecks.

Long Context Extension\nWe adopt a similar approach to DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) to enable long context\ncapabilities in DeepSeek-V3. After the pre-training stage, we apply YaRN (Peng et al., 2023a)\nfor context extension and perform two additional training phases, each comprising 1000 steps,\nto progressively expand the context window from 4K to 32K and then to 128K. The YaRN\nconfiguration is consistent with that used in DeepSeek-V2, being applied exclusively to the\ndecoupled shared key k𝑅\n𝑡. The hyper-parameters remain identical across both phases, with the\nscale𝑠=40,𝛼=1,𝛽=32, and the scaling factor√\n𝑡=0.1ln𝑠+1. In the first phase, the sequence\nlength is set to 32K, and the batch size is 1920. During the second phase, the sequence length is\nincreased to 128K, and the batch size is reduced to 480. The learning rate for both phases is set\nto 7.3×10−6, matching the final learning rate from the pre-training stage.\nThrough this two-phase extension training, DeepSeek-V3 is capable of handling inputs up to\n128K in length while maintaining strong performance. Figure 8 illustrates that DeepSeek-V3,\nfollowing supervised fine-tuning, achieves notable performance on the \"Needle In A Haystack\"\n(NIAH) test, demonstrating consistent robustness across context window lengths up to 128K.\n23",

Their hyper-parameters to control\nthe strength of auxiliary losses are the same as DeepSeek-V2-Lite and DeepSeek-V2, respectively.\nOn top of these two baseline models, keeping the training data and the other architectures the\nsame, we remove all auxiliary losses and introduce the auxiliary-loss-free balancing strategy for\ncomparison. From the table, we can observe that the auxiliary-loss-free strategy consistently\nachieves better model performance on most of the evaluation benchmarks.\n4.5.3. Batch-Wise Load Balance VS. Sequence-Wise Load Balance\nThe key distinction between auxiliary-loss-free balancing and sequence-wise auxiliary loss lies\nin their balancing scope: batch-wise versus sequence-wise. Compared with the sequence-wise\nauxiliary loss, batch-wise balancing imposes a more flexible constraint, as it does not enforce\nin-domain balance on each sequence. This flexibility allows experts to better specialize in\ndifferent domains. To validate this, we record and analyze the expert load of a 16B auxiliary-\nloss-based baseline and a 16B auxiliary-loss-free model on different domains in the Pile test set.\nAs illustrated in Figure 9, we observe that the auxiliary-loss-free model demonstrates greater\nexpert specialization patterns as expected.\nTo further investigate the correlation between this flexibility and the advantage in model\nperformance, we additionally design and validate a batch-wise auxiliary loss that encourages\nload balance on each training batch instead of on each sequence. The experimental results show\nthat, when achieving a similar level of batch-wise load balance, the batch-wise auxiliary loss\ncan also achieve similar model performance to the auxiliary-loss-free method. To be specific,\nin our experiments with 1B MoE models, the validation losses are: 2.258 (using a sequence-\nwise auxiliary loss), 2.253 (using the auxiliary-loss-free method), and 2.253 (using a batch-wise\nauxiliary loss). We also observe similar results on 3B MoE models: the model using a sequence-\nwise auxiliary loss achieves a validation loss of 2.085, and the models using the auxiliary-loss-free\nmethod or a batch-wise auxiliary loss achieve the same validation loss of 2.080.\nIn addition, although the batch-wise load balancing methods show consistent performance\nadvantages, they also face two potential challenges in efficiency: (1) load imbalance within\n27",

Supervised Fine-T uning\nWe curate our instruction-tuning datasets to include 1.5M instances spanning multiple domains,\nwith each domain employing distinct data creation methods tailored to its specific requirements.\nReasoning Data. For reasoning-related datasets, including those focused on mathematics,\ncode competition problems, and logic puzzles, we generate the data by leveraging an internal\nDeepSeek-R1 model. Specifically, while the R1-generated data demonstrates strong accuracy, it\nsuffers from issues such as overthinking, poor formatting, and excessive length. Our objective is\nto balance the high accuracy of R1-generated reasoning data and the clarity and conciseness of\nregularly formatted reasoning data.\nTo establish our methodology, we begin by developing an expert model tailored to a specific\ndomain, such as code, mathematics, or general reasoning, using a combined Supervised Fine-\nTuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) training pipeline. This expert model serves as a\ndata generator for the final model. The training process involves generating two distinct types\nof SFT samples for each instance: the first couples the problem with its original response in\nthe format of <problem, original response>, while the second incorporates a system prompt\n28",

During\nthe RL phase, the model leverages high-temperature sampling to generate responses that\nintegrate patterns from both the R1-generated and original data, even in the absence of explicit\nsystem prompts. After hundreds of RL steps, the intermediate RL model learns to incorporate\nR1 patterns, thereby enhancing overall performance strategically.\nUpon completing the RL training phase, we implement rejection sampling to curate high-\nquality SFT data for the final model, where the expert models are used as data generation\nsources. This method ensures that the final training data retains the strengths of DeepSeek-R1\nwhile producing responses that are concise and effective.\nNon-Reasoning Data. For non-reasoning data, such as creative writing, role-play, and sim-\nple question answering, we utilize DeepSeek-V2.5 to generate responses and enlist human\nannotators to verify the accuracy and correctness of the data.\nSFT Settings. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the SFT dataset, using the\ncosine decay learning rate scheduling that starts at 5×10−6and gradually decreases to 1×10−6.\nDuring training, each single sequence is packed from multiple samples. However, we adopt a\nsample masking strategy to ensure that these examples remain isolated and mutually invisible.\n5.2. Reinforcement Learning\n5.2.1. Reward Model\nWe employ a rule-based Reward Model (RM) and a model-based RM in our RL process.\nRule-Based RM. For questions that can be validated using specific rules, we adopt a rule-\nbased reward system to determine the feedback. For instance, certain math problems have\ndeterministic results, and we require the model to provide the final answer within a designated\nformat (e.g., in a box), allowing us to apply rules to verify the correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode\nproblems, we can utilize a compiler to generate feedback based on test cases. By leveraging\nrule-based validation wherever possible, we ensure a higher level of reliability, as this approach\nis resistant to manipulation or exploitation.\nModel-Based RM. For questions with free-form ground-truth answers, we rely on the reward\nmodel to determine whether the response matches the expected ground-truth. Conversely, for\nquestions without a definitive ground-truth, such as those involving creative writing, the reward\nmodel is tasked with providing feedback based on the question and the corresponding answer\nas inputs. The reward model is trained from the DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints. To enhance its\nreliability, we construct preference data that not only provides the final reward but also includes\nthe chain-of-thought leading to the reward. This approach helps mitigate the risk of reward\nhacking in specific tasks.\n29",

Group Relative Policy Optimization\nSimilar to DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimiza-\ntion (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically with the same\nsize as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.

DeepSeek-V3 achieves performance on par with the best versions of GPT-4o-0806\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022, while surpassing other versions. Additionally, the judgment ability\nof DeepSeek-V3 can also be enhanced by the voting technique. Therefore, we employ DeepSeek-\nV3 along with voting to offer self-feedback on open-ended questions, thereby improving the\neffectiveness and robustness of the alignment process.\n33",

Distillation from DeepSeek-R1\nWe ablate the contribution of distillation from DeepSeek-R1 based on DeepSeek-V2.5. The\nbaseline is trained on short CoT data, whereas its competitor uses data generated by the expert\ncheckpoints described above.\nTable 9 demonstrates the effectiveness of the distillation data, showing significant improve-\nments in both LiveCodeBench and MATH-500 benchmarks. Our experiments reveal an inter-\nesting trade-off: the distillation leads to better performance but also substantially increases the\naverage response length. To maintain a balance between model accuracy and computational\nefficiency, we carefully selected optimal settings for DeepSeek-V3 in distillation.\nOur research suggests that knowledge distillation from reasoning models presents a promis-\ning direction for post-training optimization. While our current work focuses on distilling data\nfrom mathematics and coding domains, this approach shows potential for broader applications\nacross various task domains. The effectiveness demonstrated in these specific areas indicates\nthat long-CoT distillation could be valuable for enhancing model performance in other cogni-\ntive tasks requiring complex reasoning. Further exploration of this approach across different\ndomains remains an important direction for future research.\n5.4.2. Self-Rewarding\nRewards play a pivotal role in RL, steering the optimization process. In domains where verifica-\ntion through external tools is straightforward, such as some coding or mathematics scenarios, RL\ndemonstrates exceptional efficacy. However, in more general scenarios, constructing a feedback\nmechanism through hard coding is impractical. During the development of DeepSeek-V3, for\nthese broader contexts, we employ the constitutional AI approach (Bai et al., 2022), leveraging\nthe voting evaluation results of DeepSeek-V3 itself as a feedback source.

By integrating additional constitutional inputs, DeepSeek-V3 can\noptimize towards the constitutional direction. We believe that this paradigm, which combines\nsupplementary information with LLMs as a feedback source, is of paramount importance. The\nLLM serves as a versatile processor capable of transforming unstructured information from\ndiverse scenarios into rewards, ultimately facilitating the self-improvement of LLMs. Beyond\nself-rewarding, we are also dedicated to uncovering other general and scalable rewarding\nmethods to consistently advance the model capabilities in general scenarios.\n5.4.3. Multi-Token Prediction Evaluation\nInstead of predicting just the next single token, DeepSeek-V3 predicts the next 2 tokens through\nthe MTP technique. Combined with the framework of speculative decoding (Leviathan et al.,\n2023; Xia et al., 2023), it can significantly accelerate the decoding speed of the model. A natural\nquestion arises concerning the acceptance rate of the additionally predicted token. Based on\nour evaluation, the acceptance rate of the second token prediction ranges between 85% and 90%\nacross various generation topics, demonstrating consistent reliability. This high acceptance rate\nenables DeepSeek-V3 to achieve a significantly improved decoding speed, delivering 1.8 times\nTPS (Tokens Per Second).\n6. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Directions\nIn this paper, we introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large MoE language model with 671B total pa-\nrameters and 37B activated parameters, trained on 14.8T tokens. In addition to the MLA and\nDeepSeekMoE architectures, it also pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing\nand sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. The training of\nDeepSeek-V3 is cost-effective due to the support of FP8 training and meticulous engineering op-\ntimizations. The post-training also makes a success in distilling the reasoning capability from the\nDeepSeek-R1 series of models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-V3 has\nemerged as the strongest open-source model currently available, and achieves performance com-\nparable to leading closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Despite its strong\nperformance, it also maintains economical training costs. It requires only 2.788M H800 GPU\nhours for its full training, including pre-training, context length extension, and post-training.\nWhile acknowledging its strong performance and cost-effectiveness, we also recognize that\nDeepSeek-V3 has some limitations, especially on the deployment. Firstly, to ensure efficient\ninference, the recommended deployment unit for DeepSeek-V3 is relatively large, which might\npose a burden for small-sized teams. Secondly, although our deployment strategy for DeepSeek-\nV3 has achieved an end-to-end generation speed of more than two times that of DeepSeek-V2,\nthere still remains potential for further enhancement. Fortunately, these limitations are expected\nto be naturally addressed with the development of more advanced hardware.\nDeepSeek consistently adheres to the route of open-source models with longtermism, aiming\nto steadily approach the ultimate goal of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). In the future, we\nplan to strategically invest in research across the following directions.\n•We will consistently study and refine our model architectures, aiming to further improve\nboth the training and inference efficiency, striving to approach efficient support for infinite\ncontext length. Additionally, we will try to break through the architectural limitations of\nTransformer, thereby pushing the boundaries of its modeling capabilities.\n35",

Results are smoothed by\nExponential Moving Average (EMA) with a coefficient of 0.9.\nB.1. FP8 v.s. BF16 Training\nWe validate our FP8 mixed precision framework with a comparison to BF16 training on top of\ntwo baseline models across different scales. At the small scale, we train a baseline MoE model\ncomprising approximately 16B total parameters on 1.33T tokens. At the large scale, we train a\nbaseline MoE model comprising approximately 230B total parameters on around 0.9T tokens.\nWe show the training curves in Figure 10 and demonstrate that the relative error remains below\n0.25% with our high-precision accumulation and fine-grained quantization strategies.\nB.2. Discussion About Block-Wise Quantization\nAlthough our tile-wise fine-grained quantization effectively mitigates the error introduced\nby feature outliers, it requires different groupings for activation quantization, i.e., 1x128 in\nforward pass and 128x1 for backward pass. A similar process is also required for the activation\ngradient. A straightforward strategy is to apply block-wise quantization per 128x128 elements\nlike the way we quantize the model weights. In this way, only transposition is required for\nbackward. Therefore, we conduct an experiment where all tensors associated with Dgrad are\nquantized on a block-wise basis. The results reveal that the Dgrad operation which computes\nthe activation gradients and back-propagates to shallow layers in a chain-like manner, is highly\nsensitive to precision. Specifically, block-wise quantization of activation gradients leads to\n47",

We hypothesize that this sensitivity arises because activation gradients are\nhighly imbalanced among tokens, resulting in token-correlated outliers (Xi et al., 2023). These\noutliers cannot be effectively managed by a block-wise quantization approach.\nC.Expert Specialization Patterns of the 16B Aux-Loss-Based and Aux-Loss-\nFree Models\nWe record the expert load of the 16B auxiliary-loss-based baseline and the auxiliary-loss-free\nmodel on the Pile test set.
